# firebase-nodejs-expressjs-handlebars-bootstrap-blog
Hello. This is my personal blog I created from exploring the feature-packed Firebase platform and integrating NodeJs, ExpressJs, Handlebars and Bootstrap with it.

You will need to create your new Firebase project, get its service account json and place it inside <code>/functions</code> folder. Make sure to change the filename of the service account accordingly on your <code>/functions/index.js</code>.

On your Firebase Realtime-database we need to create entries for the following:
<ul>
  <li>Blogs</li>
  <li>Blogs/all</li>
  <li>Blogs/featured</li>
  <li>Resources</li>
  <li>Counters</li>
  <li>Sitemaps</li>
  <li>Tweets</li>
</ul>
